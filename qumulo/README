To prevent committing Qumulo's API code, these directories must be populated using the qumulo API file downloaded from the GUI.  Only the top level directories exist here to force user to download the most recent API release --- Qumulo Core 2.13.0 (as of 27 Aug 2019)

Also, update QUMULO_API_VERSION in ../qrba/settings.py
